    <p>"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."</p>

    <br><p>Throughout my life I always wondered what I want to be and I'm still deciding. Therefore I have many traits and there's so much I can do. At the age of 8 you can say I was a geek when it came to electronics. I also knew how to do flips and I wanted to become a stunt double. Im also a comdian, I can make almost anybody laugh and I dont have to be trying. So as of right now my goals are to graduate highschool having honor roll for the whole year and find a good paying job to pay my share of the bills.</p>
